<h2>Ty Wittmann</h2>
<p>My degree is Virtual Design & Construction.I enjoy reading,stratagy game, and 3d printing, as well as outdoor activities such as hiking & Backpacking.
    My favorite thing about BYUI is the kind and freindly atmosphere.The advantage I see from from taking a web design course is learning if its somethings
    I'm interested in pursuing as a career, and it will allow me make my own website portfolio.
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all my life. And My favorite quote from Thomas S. Monson saying "Good 
    Timber does not grow with ease. The stronger the wind the stronger the trees". This quote helps me try to work hard and
    challenge myself to be better.</p>
